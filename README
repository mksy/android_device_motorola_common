This is the Motorola Common section.

HijackedBootmenu is included here for GB under the hijack/ folder.

Extras that need to be done:

******************************************************
*** Update the project to pull from Wizard0f0s git ***
******************************************************

At the base of your build, change to the .repo directory (cd .repo).
Edit the manifest.xml file.  File the line that points to "CyanogenMod/android_device_motorola_common" (without quotes).
Replace the "CyanogenMod" portion with "wizard0f0s" (the 0's are zeros, not o's).  Change back to the base of your repo.
Run "repo sync" to pull down the new git source.


************************************************************
*** Fix the updater-script to set the proper permissions ***
************************************************************

Download the CM7 shadow_changes.zip from here - http://goo-inside.me/devs/wizard0f0s/Hijacked_Bootmenu/CM7

Unzip the zip file directly into the device/motorola/shadow/ directory.  This will overwrite some files to create the proper updater-script and remove the onDemand gov settings from the init.mapphone_cdma.rc file.

Now you should be good to go.  I'll be writing documentation on HijackedBootmenu soon and posting a link to them here and in the bootmenu main screen.
